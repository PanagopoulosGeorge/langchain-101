        "query": "There are two ways in which a composite activity may be defined in the language of RTEC. In the first case, a composite activity definition may be specified by means of rules with \u201cinitiatedAt(F=V, T)\u201d or \u201cterminatedAt(F=V, T)\u201d in their head. This is called a simple fluent definition.\nThe first body literal of an \u201cinitiatedAt(F=V,T)\u201d rule is a positive \u201chappensAt\u201d predicate; this predicate is followed by a possibly empty set of positive or negative \u201chappensAt\u201d and \u201choldsAt\u201d predicates. Negative predicates are prefixed with \u201cnot\u201d which expresses negation-by-failure. In some cases, the body of an \u201cinitiatedAt(F=V,T)\u201d rule may include predicates expressing background knowledge.\n\u201cterminatedAt(F=V,T)\u201d rules are specified in a similar way.\nBelow you may find two examples of composite activity definitions, from the maritime domain, expressed as simple fluents.\nExample 1: Given a composite maritime activity description, provide the rules in the language of RTEC.\nComposite Maritime Activity Description: \u201cwithinArea\u201d. This activity starts when a vessel enters an area of interest. The activity ends when the vessel leaves the area that it had entered, or when the vessel stops transmitting its position, since we can no longer assume that the vessel remains in the same area in the case of transmission gaps.\nAnswer:\nThe activity \u201cwithinArea\u201d is expressed as a Boolean simple fluent with two arguments, i.e., \u201cVessel\u201d and \u201cAreaType\u201d. This activity starts when a vessel enters an area of interest. We use an \"initiatedAt\" rule to express this initiation condition. The body literals of this rules are an event labelled \u201centersArea\u201d with two arguments, \u201cVessel\u201d and \u201cArea\u201d, and a background knowledge predicate named \u201careaType\u201d with two arguments, \u201cArea\u201d and \u201cAreaType\u201d. This rule in the language of RTEC is the following:\ninitiatedAt(withinArea(Vessel, AreaType)=true, T) :-\nhappensAt(entersArea(Vessel, Area), T),\nareaType(Area, AreaType).\nThe activity \u201cwithinArea\u201d ends when a vessel leaves the area that it had entered. We use a \u201cterminatedAt\u201d rule to describe this termination condition. This rule includes an event named \u201cleavesArea\u201d with two arguments, i.e. \u201cVessel\u201d and \u201cArea\u201d, and the background knowledge predicate \u201careaType\u201d. This rule in the language of RTEC language is:\nterminatedAt(withinArea(Vessel, AreaType)=true, T) :-\nhappensAt(leavesArea(Vessel, Area), T),\nareaType(Area, AreaType).\nIn addition to the aforementioned conditions, the activity \u201cwithinArea\u201d ends when the vessel stops transmitting its position, i.e. when a communication gap starts. We use a \u201cterminatedAt\u201d rule to express this termination condition. In this rule, the second argument of the \u201cwithinArea\u201d fluent is a \u2018free\u2019 Prolog variable, i.e. a variable starting with \u2018_\u2019. The body of this rule includes a single event named \u201cgap_start\u201d with one argument, i.e. \u201cVessel\u201d. This rule in the language of RTEC is:\nterminatedAt(withinArea(Vessel, _AreaType)=true, T) :-\nhappensAt(gap_start(Vessel), T).",

This activity starts when a vessel becomes idle near some port or far from all ports. The activity ends when the vessel stops being idle, i.e., when it starts to move. When there is a gap in signal transmissions, we can no longer assume that the vessel remains stopped.\nAnswer: The activity \u201cstopped\u201d is expressed as a simple fluent. This activity starts when a vessel becomes idle near some port. We use an \u201cinitiatedAt\u201d rule to describe this initiation condition. The output is the fluent \u201cstopped\u201d, which has one argument, i.e. \u201cVessel\u201d, and value \u201cnearPorts\u201d. The \u201cinitiatedAt\u201d rule includes an event named \u201cstop_start\u201d with one argument, i.e. \u201cVessel\u201d. We verify that the vessel is currently near some port by requiring that the fluent-value pair \u201cwithinArea(Vessel, nearPorts)=true\u201d must hold. This condition refers to the activity \u201cwithinArea\u201d, which was learned in a previous example. This rule in the language of RTEC is:\ninitiatedAt(stopped(Vessel)=nearPorts, T) :-\nhappensAt(stop_start(Vessel), T),\nholdsAt(withinArea(Vessel, nearPorts)=true, T).\nThe activity \u201cstopped\u201d may also start when a vessel becomes idle far from all ports. In this case, the \u201cstopped\u201d fluent has value \u201cfarFromPorts\u201d. We use an \u201cinitiatedAt\u201d rule to express this initiation condition. The body of this rule includes an event named \u201cstop_start\u201d with one argument, i.e. \u201cVessel\u201d. We verify that the vessel is currently far from all ports by requiring that the fluent-value pair \u201cwithinArea(Vessel, nearPorts)=true\u201d does not hold. This rule in the language of RTEC is:\ninitiatedAt(stopped(Vessel)=farFromPorts, T) :-\nhappensAt(stop_start(Vessel), T),\nnot holdsAt(withinArea(Vessel, nearPorts)=true, T).\nThe activity \u201cstopped\u201d ends when a vessel stops being idle, irrespective of the location of the vessel. We use a \u201cterminatedAt\u201d rule to express this termination condition. Moreover, we use a free Prolog variable to express the value of the \u201cstopped\u201d fluent, called \u201c_Status\u201d, i.e. we place no constraints on the value of the \u201cstopped\u201d fluent. The \u201cterminatedAt\u201d rule includes a single event named \u201cstop_end\u201d with one argument, i.e. \u201cVessel\u201d. This rule in the language of RTEC is:\nterminatedAt(stopped(Vessel)=_Status, T) :-\nhappensAt(stop_end(Vessel), T).\nThe activity \u201cstopped\u201d may also end when a communication gap starts. We use a \u201cterminatedAt\u201d rule to express this termination condition. This rule includes the built-in \u201cstart\u201d event of RTEC, which expresses the start times of the maximal intervals of a given fluent-value pair. In this case, the \u201cstart\u201d event is applied to the gap fluent, expressing the times at which a communication gap for the vessel in question starts. This rule in the language of RTEC is:\nterminatedAt(stopped(Vessel)=_Status, T) :-\nhappensAt(start(gap(Vessel)=_GapStatus), T).",

In this case, a composite activity definition may be specified by means of a rule with \u201choldsFor(F=V, I)\u201d in its head. The body of such a rule may include \u201choldsFor\u201d conditions for fluents other than F, as well as some of the interval manipulation constructs of RTEC, i.e. \u201cunion_all\u201d, \u201cintersect_all\u201d, and \u201crelative_complement_all\u201d. In some cases, a \u201choldsFor(F=V, I)\u201d rule may include predicates expressing background knowledge. A rule with \u201choldsFor(F=V, I)\u201d in the head is called a statically determined fluent definition. Below you may find two examples of composite maritime activities expressed as statically determined fluents.\nExample 1: Given a composite maritime activity description, provide the rules in the language of RTEC.\nComposite Maritime Activity Description: \u201cunderWay\u201d. This activity lasts as long as a vessel is not stopped.\nAnswer: The activity \u201cunderWay\u201d is expressed as a statically determined fluent. Rules with \u201choldsFor\u201d in the head specify the conditions in which a fluent holds. We use a \u201choldsFor\u201d rule to describe that the \u201cunderWay\u201d activity lasts as long as a vessel is not stopped. The output is \u0392oolean fluent named \u201cunderWay\u201d with one argument, i.e. \u201cVessel\u201d. We specify \u201cunderWay\u201d with the use of the fluent \u201cmovingSpeed\u201d.

Disjunction in \u201choldsFor\u201d rules is expressed by means of \u201cunion_all\u201d.

Furthermore, neither of the two vessels should be a tug boat or a pilot vessel. We are interested in vessel meetings whose duration exceeds the expected minimum time required for a suspicious action, like an illegal cargo transfer.\nAnswer: The activity \u201crendezVous\u201d is expressed as a statically determined fluent. We use a \u201choldsFor\u201d rule to describe that the \u201crendezVous\u201d activity lasts as long as two vessels, neither of which is a tug boat or a pilot vessel, are both sailing at a low speed or are stopped far from all ports, while neither of them is close to a port or a coastline. The output is a Boolean fluent named \u201crendezVous\u201d with two arguments, i.e. \u201cVessel1\u201d and \u201cVessel2\u201d. To express that the two vessels must be close to each other, we use a Boolean fluent named \u201cproximity\u201d with two arguments, i.e. \u201cVessel1\u201d and \u201cVessel2\u201d. To express that neither of the vessels is a tug boat or a pilot vessel, we use a background knowledge predicate named \u201coneIsTug\u201d with two arguments, i.e. \u201cVessel1\u201d and \u201cVessel2\u201d, and a background knowledge predicate named \u201coneIsPilot\u201d with two arguments, i.e. \u201cVessel1\u201d and \u201cVessel2\u201d, and require that these predicates do not hold using \u201cnot\u201d. To express that \u201cVessel1\u201d has a low speed or it is stopped far from all ports, we use the predicate \u201cunion_all\u201d. Similarly, we employ \u201cunion_all\u201d to express that \u201cVessel2\u201d has a low speed or it is stopped far from all ports. Next, we use the predicate \u201cintersect_all\u201d to express the conjunction of these two events, i.e., that both vessels need to have a low speed or be stopped far from all ports. Subsequently, we need to express that neither of the two vessels is near a port or a coastline at this time. To do this, we employ the predicate \u201crelative_complement_all\u201d, in order to exclude the situations where \u201cVessel1\u201d is near a port, \u201cVessel1\u201d is near a coastline, \u201cVessel2\u201d is near a port or \u201cVessel2\u201d is near a coastline. Finally, we need to express that the duration of the activity is greater than the minimum expected duration of a rendez-vous among vessels. To do this, we use the background knowledge predicate \u201cthresholds\u201d to retrieve this minimum duration from background knowledge and store it in the variable \u201cRendezvousTime\u201d. Then, we use the background knowledge predicate \u201cintDurGreater\u201d in order to filter the intervals that have been computed so far, maintaining only the ones whose duration exceeds \u201cRendezvousTime\u201d.
